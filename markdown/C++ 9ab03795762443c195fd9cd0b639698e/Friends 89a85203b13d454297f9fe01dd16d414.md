# Friends

a **friend function** is a special type of function that is allowed to access the private and 
protected members of a class, even though it is not a member of that class. This capability is useful in situations where you want to allow certain functions to operate on the internal data of a class without exposing that data through public member functions.

```cpp
class Dog
{
  friend void debug_dog_info(const Dog& d);
  private:
      std::string m_name;
      int m_age;
  public:
      Dog(const std::string &name, int age) 
      : m_name(name), m_age(age) {};

};
```

```cpp
void debug_dog_info(const Dog& d){
    cout << "Dog | name[" 
    << d.m_name << ", age: " << 
    d.m_age << "]" << endl;
}
```

We can also friend classes where we can access the member variables of those classes we be friended.

```cpp
friend class Cat;
```

```cpp
class Cat{
  private:
      std::string m_name;
      int m_age;
  public:
      Cat(const std::string &name, int age) 
      : m_name(name), m_age(age) {};
      void print_dog(const Dog& d){
          cout << "Dog | name[" 
          << d.m_name << ", age: " 
          << d.m_age << "]" << endl;
      }
};
```
