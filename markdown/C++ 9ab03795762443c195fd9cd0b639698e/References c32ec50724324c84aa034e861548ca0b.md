# References

References in C++ are a way to create an alias for an existing variable. They provide an alternative name for a variable, allowing you to access and modify the original variable through the reference.

A reference is declared using the `&` operator. For example, `int& ref = x;` creates a reference `ref` to the variable `x`. 

References must be initialized when they are declared and cannot be changed to refer to a different variable later though you can make a pointer point to some other address in runtime.

References do not create a copy of the variable, they just provide an alternative name to access the same memory location. This can improve performance compared to passing copies of variables. 

```cpp
int num {38};
int& r_num {num};
```

**Constant reference:** 

You canâ€™t use reference to change the original value if the reference is constant

```cpp
const int& r_number {number};
```

**Pointer with similar behavior as `const` references:**

```cpp
const int* const const_ptr_to_const_age {&age}
```

`const int*` : This is a pointer to a constant integer. The pointer itself is not constant, but the value it points to is constant and cannot be modified.

`const`: This is the second `const` keyword, and it makes the pointer itself constant. This means that the pointer cannot be modified to point to a different address.
