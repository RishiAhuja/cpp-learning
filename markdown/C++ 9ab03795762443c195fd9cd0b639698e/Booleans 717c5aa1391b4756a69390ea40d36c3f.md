# Booleans

The `bool` data type in C++ is used to represent logical values, which can only have two possible values: `true` and `false`.

Boolean variables are particularly useful in decision-making processes and control flow structures, such as if-else statements and loops, as they allow the code to execute certain instructions only when a particular boolean condition is met.

**Memory Allocation**: When a `bool` variable is declared, it reserves one byte of memory to store the value. This is because memory is byte-addressable, and a byte is the smallest unit of memory that can be accessed directly. Although `bool` variables only require a single bit to store the value, they occupy a full byte in memory.

```cpp
bool b = true;

std::cout << "Size of bool: " << sizeof(bool) << std::endl;
```

```cpp
//output

Size of bool: 1
```

if we try to `std::cout` a bool variable, it usually prints either `0` or `1`

```cpp
bool green_light {true};
bool red_light {false};

std::cout << "Red light: " << red_light << std::endl;
std::cout << "Green light: " << green_light << std::endl;
```

```cpp
//output

Red light: 0
Green light: 1
```

`std::cout << std::boolalpha` is a manipulator in C++ that is used with the `std::cout` stream to control the formatting of boolean values. It is used to display boolean values as words ("true" or "false") instead of numeric values (1 or 0) by default.

```cpp
std::cout << std::boolalpha;
std::cout << "Red light: " << red_light << std::endl;
std::cout << "Green light: " << green_light << std::endl;
```

```cpp
//output

Red light: false
Green light: true
```
